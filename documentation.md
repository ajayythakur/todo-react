**Documentation: React TODO App**

**Features:**

1. **Adding Todos:** Users can add TODOs using the input bar and pressing the "Add Task" button.

2. **List of TODO Cards:** Active TODOs are displayed in a list, and completed TODOs are shown separately.

3. **Completing Todos:** Clicking the "check" icon marks a TODO as complete and moves it to the completed tasks section.

4. **Removing Todos:** Clicking the "delete" button removes a TODO from the active tasks list.

5. **Clear All Todos:** Users can clear all active tasks by clicking the "Remove All Task" button.

**Assumptions:**

1. The app relies on the browser's `localStorage` for storing TODOs, but it doesn't handle errors related to storage limits or unavailable storage.

2. It assumes that TODOs should not be empty, and it shows an alert if an empty task is added.

3. Styling and layout details (e.g., CSS classes) are not provided in this code and should be assumed to exist in an external stylesheet.

4. The app doesn't specify any backend interaction, so it's assumed that TODOs are stored only in the client's local storage.

5. The "material-symbols-outlined" class is used for icons, but the source of these icons is not defined in the code.

**Unhandled Edge Cases:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code doesn't handle potential errors when interacting with `localStorage`, like exceeding storage limits or storage being disabled in the browser.

2. **Validation:** While it checks for empty tasks, it doesn't validate the format or length of the tasks. Invalid data may lead to unexpected behavior.

3. **Scalability:** Performance may degrade with a large number of TODOs in local storage since it doesn't implement any pagination or optimization for handling a large list.

4. **Accessibility:** The code doesn't include accessibility features like ARIA labels or roles, which are essential for making the app usable by people with disabilities.

5. **Internationalization:** The app assumes English text; support for other languages is not considered.

6. **Cross-browser Compatibility:** The code may not work consistently on all browsers due to variations in how `localStorage` is supported.

7. **Data Synchronization:** If the app is used on multiple devices, there's no synchronization of TODOs between devices.

Please note that this code represents a simplified TODO app and might require further development and testing for production use.
